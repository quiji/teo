## Brainstorming

### Game Mechanics

Blocking projectiles and storing them into satchel for future use (like *throwing back*).
Satchel works like a stack: first item in is last item out.

Thats it. Ha!


## Assets

List of assets being used. 

- VisualLogger: A plugin I made to log data into the screen.



## Todo

- Make bullets rigid bodies. Let them bounce around and add height and free fall to bullets before turning them into pickables. Let them bounce with each other too.
- Make Teo stop wen throwing to let him aim and let him charge the shot.
- Make Teo and enemy bounce back when hit
- Implement simple enemy AI, make them move and choose when to throw. Limit the amount of throws to avoid farming bullets.
